# Uncommon ZeroDivisionError in Python

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur in Python related to division by zero when handling edge cases.

The `bug.py` file contains a function that attempts to handle division by zero in a somewhat naive way, leaving an edge case unhandled. The `bugSolution.py` file presents a solution.
